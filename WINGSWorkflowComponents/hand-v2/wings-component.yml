name: HAND
version: 2.0.0
description: The Height Above the Nearest Drainage, or HAND, is a model that normalizes topography according to the local relative heights found along a given drainage network. This model's output shows a high correlation with the depth of the water table in a region, this provides an accurate spacial representation of soil water environments. HAND takes in a Digital Elevation Map of a given region as input data. With this it will output the normalized draining potential, or relative vertical flowpath-distances to the nearest drainages.
